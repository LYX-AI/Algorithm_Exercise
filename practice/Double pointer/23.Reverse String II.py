    Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

example:
    Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

trace of though is same like String Reverse ,the most important is to pay 
attention to how large is the next step
